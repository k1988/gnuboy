* WHAT'S NEW *

Here you will find a summary of the changes made in each released
version of gnuboy, organized from an end-user perspective.
Webmasters, please use this file as a basis for announcing new
versions; the CHANGES file is too technical and unorganized.



RELEASE 0.9.9

  NEW FEATURES

DOS port is now entirely thinlib-based. Should be more robust, featureful.
For example, custom video modes such as 256x224 are available.

  PERFORMANCE

New asm routines for displaying the background layer on color games.
This results in a significant performance boost low-end machines (~P75).
SDL code no longer fakes 16bpp but uses the native color depth.

  BUGS FIXED

SDL gnuboy no longer produces random pops in sound at startup.
Mono/stereo should now be handled correctly in the SDL code.
Eliminated compiletime error about SDL_DISABLE on SDL ver < 1.1.8.
Serious bug -- loading savestates was not updating the memory bank map --
resulted in bogus behavior after loading in certain situations.
Scrapped SDL_HWSURFACE to make fullscreen work on Windows.



RELEASE 0.9.8

  NEW FEATURES

Native SDL sound support. This means sound will work on BeOS and Windows.
Sprites are priority sorted on DMG games by default now.
ROMs can be loaded from stdin using "-" as the filename.
SDL port now runs fullscreen by default. Set sdl_fullscreen to 0 to disable.
SDL port now supports alt+enter fullscreen toggle.
Integrated Windows port by mewse (using SDL and mingw32).

  COMPATIBILITY

Added support for undocumented ram size 05 (presumably 256 kbit).
This fixes the crash with Pokemon Crystal.
Removed hacks for Altered Space and W&W because they break other games.
Added new VBLANK code that should fix them again without breaking other stuff.

  BUGS FIXED

SDL keyboard handler was not accepting the numeral keys.
SDL video was messed up bad when it couldn't get a true 160x144 display.
Loading a ROM with bogus ROM/RAM size headers used to crash the program.



RELEASE 0.9.7

  NEW FEATURES

DOS sound support!
VESA video modes on DOS!
Mono sound for cards that don't support stereo.

  COMPATIBILITY

Altered Space and Wizards & Warriors now run.
Change was made to VBLANK behavior; hopefully it doesn't break other games.

  BUGS FIXED

Envelope length was being computed wrong.
HDMA was incorrectly taking place all at once.
Command line parsing incorrectly changed - to _ in places it shouldn't.
SDL joystick support was not building correctly on non-Linux systems.



RELEASE 0.9.5

  NEW FEATURES

Showing the name from the ROM header in X11 and SDL titlebars.
The various targets can be disabled at compiletime with --without-* options.
OSS sound support might work on FreeBSD and OpenBSD but is untested.
SDL joystick support.
GNU make no longer required to compile.

  OPTIMIZATIONS

Flags handling in the C and asm cpu cores should be faster.
Word-at-a-time memory I/O is now done more efficiently.

  BUGS FIXED

Highcolor screens no longer flicker.
Misplaced high-pitched beeps in sound have been removed, again.
C graphics code was misaligning the screen by one pixel. Fixed.



RELEASE 0.9.4

  NEW FEATURES

Linux fbcon display support.
Linux joystick device support.

  COMPATIBILITY

HDMA now works in DKC and Lemmings Color.
Default wave pattern is now supported.



RELEASE 0.9.2

  NEW FEATURES

SDL port!
Sound channel 4.
MBC3 RTC support.

  COMPATIBILITY

Sound is now properly handled in savestates.
Pokemon Silver and Gold should now be playable.

  BUGS FIXED

Another bug in sweep.
Nasty aliasing from extremely high sound frequencies.



RELEASE 0.9.1

  NEW FEATURES

Experimental sound support!
Better command line parsing.
Added --showvars command line option.
Various optimizations.

  BUGS FIXED

HDMA bug.
LCDC STAT interrupt bug.



NOTE: Earlier releases have not yet been documented in this file.
Hopefully they'll be added eventually, at least for the sake of
completing the records.
