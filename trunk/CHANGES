0.9.5
added Ralf to the CREDITS, apologies for the prior omission
show name from rom header in window title on X11 and SDL
fixed bug that made highcolor screen flicker
(this used to glitch sfalpha, but for some reason its ok now)
updated README
fixed cap on sound 3 frequency to eliminate bogus beeps
began work on optimizing memory io in the C code
updated HACKING slightly
got new fast memory io functions integrated!
moved all of high memory (registers, wave pattern, stack) to one array
(eventually this will make memory io faster)
changed savestate format, but old saves should still load fine
(hopefully new format makes more sense)
began implementing fast access to high memory
discovered that low bits of the flags register don't exist
optimized instruction emulation accordingly
a few optimizations to the outer asm cpu loop
fixed off-by-one error in C graphics code that made far right column blank
added slow, experimental 24bpp (packed, unaligned) video support
improved the configure script, now --without-* works
use sdl-config instead of explicit -lpthread to support more systems
removed stupid section directives from the asm
got the asm cores working on dos!
oss sound support *might* work on freebsd and openbsd now
SDL joystick code has been integrated, but I haven't tested it
fixed bug in new savestate code
added David Lau to the CREDITS (SDL joystick support)
GNU make should no longer be required to compile

0.9.4
various changes to lots of the system interface organization
separation of linux fb and keyboard handling code into two modules
integrated linux joystick support contributed by Ralf Hoffmann
dummy joystick code for systems without real support yet
fixed HDMA; now DKC runs perfectly

0.9.3
explicit link of SDL target with -lpthread, tell me if this causes problems
better cpu detection in configure script
more big fixes in sweep, and now it's actually tested, so it SHOULD work (!)
implemented default wave ram pattern
added linux fbcon display support - very functional
fix to allow new custom palette to take effect after loading dmg savestates

0.9.2
mbc3 rtc support, including save and resync across sessions
updated README
implemented sound channel 4
fixed yet another bug in sweep (!!)
fixed nasty aliasing when sound frequency was higher than sample rate permits
finally, all sound registers can be adjusted while sound is being produced
made it so the proper shutdown functions actually get called on exit
added SDL port by Damian M Gryski, should be auto-detected by configure
added Damian to the CREDITS file
cleaned up sound code to minimize the amount of state data kept
added sound and rtc status to savestates; this won't break old saves
changed lots of lookup tables to const

0.9.1
fixed yet another critical bug in sweep
fixed STAT interrupt bug
added support for changing more sound params while sound is active
fixed yet another major bug in envelope for channel 2
fixed bug in HDMA, but DKC still fails
updated README, HACKING
made samplerate and sound (on/off) configurable rcvars
changed command line parsing to make setting bools more intuitive
added --showvars to list all available rcvars

0.9.0
fixed bugs in sweep and envelope functions
added sound channel 3

0.8.5
various minor optimizations in the C code
same in the i386 asm cpu core
initial work on sound framework
oss sound output for use on *nix
dummy sound output for use on systems without sound
sound channels 1 and 2

0.8.4
updated README to cover new features
fixed off-by-one-line visual error introduced in 0.8.2
gbspec.txt is wrong, ram size code 0 != no ram, big suprise... (!)
workaround for undocumented 512 byte ram size, won't necessarily work
changes in saved state format
slight improvements to asm cpu core
cleaned up HDMA code
removed outdated comments
more changes to lcdc/cpu timing interaction, fixing harmless bugs
this may slightly impact performance, i'll compensate later
hopefully fixed bug in svgalib interface that corrupted console on exit
updated HACKING to reflect new code, detail more internals
workaround for a bug that would never happen but could lock the emulator
fixed another visual glitch introduced in 0.8.2
optimized i386 cpu.s to keep PC in a register at all times

0.8.3
changed install dir from $prefix/games to $prefix/bin
fixed major bug in ramsize lookup table (!)
updated HACKING to note that it's outdated
implemented saved states!

0.8.2
rewrote lcdc state behavior completely, fixed lots of compat issues
implemented serial io failure for roms that need it, fixed more compat
now, mk1, sml2, and alleyway are all fixed!
additions to input.h and keytable.c to allow future joystick support

0.8.1
fixed stupid timer interrupt bug in asm cpu core
renamed screen to fb so as not to conflict with allegro symbol names

0.8.0
initial release
