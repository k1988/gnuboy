#summary Information on the native SDL Dingoo A320 port

= Introduction =

This is a port for the China Chip A320 [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dingoo Dingoo], a MIPS based device. The A320 has a "native" OS ÂµC/OS-II (uCOS II) and users can install Dingux, a Linux port. This port is known to work for the native OS and should work for [http://code.google.com/p/dingoo-linux/ Dingux] ([http://www.dingux.com/ also see]) too.


= Details =

At the moment the port is a .APP, and hard coded to run "adjustris.gb" (available from http://www.pdroms.de/files/910/) in the same directory that the binary is found. NOTE the rom doesn't need to be Adjustris it just needs to have that filename. Also if a rom is passed in as an argument that will be used as the rom name instead.
