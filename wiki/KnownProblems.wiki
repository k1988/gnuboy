#summary Known issues, aka todo list :-)

= Known problems =

  * Glitch in intro/cut scene for GBC games The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Seasons and also The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Ages. Bars at top of screen should be black. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gambatte/ Gambatte] does not have this problem

= To Do =

  * zip file support?
  * Find enhancements implemented in other ports and integrate into this release
  * [http://brunni.dev-fr.org/index.php?page=pcsoft_heigboy ColourIt] support
  * Check Gambatte test cases, there are many hardware tests cartridges implemented in that project
  * Improve scalars, this may be tricky with regard to licensing.  See note in [http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/browse/trunk/README README] regarding Eagle/2xSaI
  * Add a menu (avoid command line), see Lemon Boy, Oh Boy, various console ports, etc.
  * check performance of memcpy, some ports of gnuboy implement a custom memcpy with the reason that it gained frames per seconds.
  * add screen shots to save slots (related to "add menu")
