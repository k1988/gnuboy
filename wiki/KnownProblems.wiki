#summary Known issues, aka todo list :-)

= Known problems =

  * Glitch in intro/cut scene for GBC games The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Seasons and also The Legend of Zelda - Oracle of Ages. Bars at top and the bottom of the screen should be black (top bar is correctly shown). [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gambatte/ Gambatte] does not have this problem

= To Do =

  * Add frame skip (frameskip) option for slow machines.
  * Fix compile warnings
  * Add save screen shot support
  * Add skins support, aka background images (for non-scaled view with a border)
  * Add built in colorscale mapping for GB games (rather than defaulting)
  * .zip (i.e.pkzip) file support? gzip support is already present (albeit a VERY slow implementation)
  * Find enhancements implemented in other ports and integrate into this release
  * [http://brunni.dev-fr.org/index.php?page=pcsoft_heigboy ColourIt] support
  * Check [http://gambatte.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/gambatte/hwtests/ Gambatte test cases], there are many hardware tests cartridges implemented in that project
  * Improve scalars, this may be tricky with regard to licensing.  See note in [http://code.google.com/p/gnuboy/source/browse/trunk/README README] regarding Eagle/2xSaI. Note http://scale2x.sourceforge.net/download.html would be suitable as it is also GPL. Or implement some of the ideas from http://www.compuphase.com/graphic/scale.htm
  * Add a menu (avoid command line), see Lemon Boy, Oh Boy, various console ports, etc.
  * Check performance of memcpy, some ports of gnuboy implement a custom memcpy with the reason that it gained frames per seconds.
  * Add screen shots to save slots (related to "add menu")
