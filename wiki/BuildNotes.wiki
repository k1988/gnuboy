#summary Notes on building/running

GCC is known to work on a number on platforms.

= Windows =

Known to build/run with gcc and SDL (1.2).

{{{
make -B -f Makfile.win
}}}

= Linux =

{{{
./configure --with-sdl
make
}}}

= Running =

NOTE SDL will take what ever surface it can find, if you are running dual/multi head displays you may get odd results in fullscreen mode (the default). Suggestion try running in a window.

{{{
./sdlgnuboy --fullscreen=0 ROM_NAME  # start in a window
./sdlgnuboy ROM_NAME  # full screen is the default
}}}
