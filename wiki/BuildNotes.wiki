#summary Notes on building/running

GCC is known to work on a number on platforms.

= Windows =

Known to build/run with gcc (3.4.2) and SDL (1.2).

{{{
make -B -f Makfile.win
}}}

= Linux =

Tested under x86. Known to work with gcc 4.2.2.

{{{
sh ./configure --with-sdl
make
}}}


= Dingoo Native SDL =

gcc 4.1.2
{{{
make -B -f Makefile.dingoo
}}}

= Pandora and SDL =

{{{
make -f Makefile.pandora
}}}


= Running =

NOTE SDL will take what ever surface it can find, if you are running dual/multi head displays you may get odd results in fullscreen mode (the default). Suggestion try running in a window.

{{{
./sdlgnuboy --fullscreen=0 ROM_NAME  # start in a window
./sdlgnuboy ROM_NAME  # full screen is the default
}}}
