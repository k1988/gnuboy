#summary Notes on building/running

GCC is known to work on a number on platforms.

There is an autotools configure shell script, try that first. For cross compiling you may want to create a static Makefile, see the examples in the source already (Windows and Dingoo).

= Compile/Build options =

There are a few options in the code that can be disabled, e.g. in case libraries are not available or functionality is not wanted (or implemented in a specific port). E.g.:

  * screen shots
  * .zip file support
  * sound support, i.e. can build without sound (output) support
  * joystick support

= Windows =

Known to build/run with gcc (3.4.2) and SDL (1.2).

{{{
make -B -f Makfile.win
}}}

= Linux =

Tested under x86. Known to work with gcc 4.2.2 and 4.6.3.

{{{
sh ./configure --with-sdl
make -B sdlgnuboy 2>&1 |tee build_sdl.log
}}}


= Dingoo Native SDL =

gcc 4.1.2
{{{
make -B -f Makefile.dingoo
}}}

= Pandora and SDL =

{{{
make -f Makefile.pandora
}}}


= Running =

NOTE SDL will take what ever surface it can find, if you are running dual/multi head displays you may get odd results in fullscreen mode (the default). Suggestion try running in a window.

{{{
./sdlgnuboy --fullscreen=0 ROM_NAME  # start in a window
./sdlgnuboy ROM_NAME  # full screen is the default
}}}
