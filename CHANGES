0.9.2
mbc3 rtc support, including save and resync across sessions
updated README
implemented sound channel 4
fixed yet another bug in sweep (!!)
fixed nasty aliasing when sound frequency was higher than sample rate permits
finally, all sound registers can be adjusted while sound is being produced
made it so the proper shutdown functions actually get called on exit
added SDL port by Damian M Gryski, should be auto-detected by configure
added Damian to the CREDITS file
cleaned up sound code to minimize the amount of state data kept
added sound and rtc status to savestates; this won't break old saves
changed lots of lookup tables to const

0.9.1
fixed yet another critical bug in sweep
fixed STAT interrupt bug
added support for changing more sound params while sound is active
fixed yet another major bug in envelope for channel 2
fixed bug in HDMA, but DKC still fails
updated README, HACKING
made samplerate and sound (on/off) configurable rcvars
changed command line parsing to make setting bools more intuitive
added --showvars to list all available rcvars

0.9.0
fixed bugs in sweep and envelope functions
added sound channel 3

0.8.5
various minor optimizations in the C code
same in the i386 asm cpu core
initial work on sound framework
oss sound output for use on *nix
dummy sound output for use on systems without sound
sound channels 1 and 2

0.8.4
updated README to cover new features
fixed off-by-one-line visual error introduced in 0.8.2
gbspec.txt is wrong, ram size code 0 != no ram, big suprise... (!)
workaround for undocumented 512 byte ram size, won't necessarily work
changes in saved state format
slight improvements to asm cpu core
cleaned up HDMA code
removed outdated comments
more changes to lcdc/cpu timing interaction, fixing harmless bugs
this may slightly impact performance, i'll compensate later
hopefully fixed bug in svgalib interface that corrupted console on exit
updated HACKING to reflect new code, detail more internals
workaround for a bug that would never happen but could lock the emulator
fixed another visual glitch introduced in 0.8.2
optimized i386 cpu.s to keep PC in a register at all times

0.8.3
changed install dir from $prefix/games to $prefix/bin
fixed major bug in ramsize lookup table (!)
updated HACKING to note that it's outdated
implemented saved states!

0.8.2
rewrote lcdc state behavior completely, fixed lots of compat issues
implemented serial io failure for roms that need it, fixed more compat
now, mk1, sml2, and alleyway are all fixed!
additions to input.h and keytable.c to allow future joystick support

0.8.1
fixed stupid timer interrupt bug in asm cpu core
renamed screen to fb so as not to conflict with allegro symbol names

0.8.0
